## Wallpapers

The wallpapers were downloaded from [dynamicwallpaper.club](https://dynamicwallpaper.club/wallpaper/f9kth9lc1w). Please download the wallpaper from there and not here since I am not the original creator. The `macos` folder contains a `heic` file since that is more or less sufficient there, for windows, we need to extract the jpegs.
